### Important things inside PHP for web pentesting
Here inside this repo, I am listing important things or should I say the topics which we need to look at during web pentesting mostly the I am playing with FORM inside this.
The more you know better for you in the future but yes Here you will get an overview of things that matter more according to my understanding.
Inside the file, you will see lots of code if you are a newbie, whenever you find anything inside the code try mode to learn more about it and how hackers exploit it.
My opinion with this tries to refer https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp for better understanding.

#### FORM 
plays an important in any website so concerning it here I design a form for filling your resume detail and show on the next page with image upload for fun purpose only make sure home.php, CV_form.php, welcome.php and make sure to create image folder(for image) inside same directory where you place other 3 php file
- Basically, there are 3 pages where 1 page is for basic authentication with username = 'admin' and password = "123".(page name=home.php) after that 
- CV_Form.php page for filling out the details with basic data sanitization.
- Then the last page Welcome.php for just showing out the output 
- style.css is just for better UI nothing to do with PHP.

All these pages mostly use session, cookie,post methods, and some validation which I think you should take a look for basic understanding.


#### Hash_Generator
The generator contains the file, first is hash.csss and the second one is hash.php.
The second one is important in our aspect, apart from designing and focusing on PHP here in this you will see the major combination and basic understanding of hash and why they are important for database storage.
